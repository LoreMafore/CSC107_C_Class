/*****************************************************************************
*  Write a C program that outputs the amount of a savings account each year 
*  for 10 years, give an input initial amount and interest rate.  A for loop 
*  iterates 10 times, such that each iteration represents one year, output 
*  that yearâ€™s savings amount in proper dollar format.
* 
*  Example
*  Enter initial savings: 10000
*  Enter interest rate  : 0.05
*
*  Annual savings for 10 years: 
*  $10000.00
*  $10500.00
*  $11025.00
*  $11576.25
